# Personal And In Nature

Reimagining Pain from the Personal to the Planetary

PPP (Personal–Planetary–Pain) is an interactive map that explores the interconnectedness of ecological loss, socioeconomic suffering, and the human pain experience. When the Earth is in pain, we are in pain. Through the concept of "phantom scars,” the Earth’s pain is illustrated by craters on the map that are sonified by their type of destruction. Using the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), PPP links human and environmental pain to imbalances in the five elements—Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water. Users are invited to share their own narratives of pain, which become part of a growing collective memory tied to sites of ecological distress around the world. By weaving together the personal and the planetary, the PPP map highlights both micro and macro crises, encouraging reflection on how ecological and health challenges leave lasting, interconnected imprints.
